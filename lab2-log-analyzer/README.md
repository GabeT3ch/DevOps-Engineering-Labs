# Lab 02 - Log Analyzer

## Overview

A Python script that parses system log files, extracts key information, and generates a summary report. Built to process logs like those generated by Lab 01's System Resource Monitor, but works with any standard log format.

This is a common DevOps task — when something breaks at 3 AM, the first thing you do is dig through logs. This tool automates that process.

## What This Lab Covers

- Python file parsing and string manipulation
- Working with log formats and timestamps
- Filtering and counting patterns
- Generating summary reports
- Command-line arguments with `argparse`
- Git branching workflow (feature branch → PR → merge)

## Environment

- **OS:** Fedora Linux
- **Python:** 3.x
- **Input:** Any log file with timestamped entries

## Setup

```bash
# No external dependencies — uses Python standard library only
python3 log_analyzer.py sample.log
```

## What It Does

1. Reads a log file line by line
2. Categorizes entries by log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
3. Counts occurrences of each level
4. Optionally filters by keyword or time range
5. Outputs a summary report to the terminal

## Usage

```bash
# Basic summary of a log file
python3 log_analyzer.py sample.log

# Filter for warnings and errors only
python3 log_analyzer.py sample.log --level WARNING

# Search for a keyword
python3 log_analyzer.py sample.log --keyword "CPU"

# Filter by time range
python3 log_analyzer.py sample.log --after "2026-02-16 12:30:00" --before "2026-02-16 12:40:00"
```

## Example Output

```
=== Log Analysis Report ===
File: sample.log
Total entries: 45
--------------------------
INFO:     30
WARNING:  10
ERROR:    4
CRITICAL: 1
--------------------------
Time range: 2026-02-16 12:00:00 → 2026-02-16 13:00:00

Top 3 most frequent messages:
  1. CPU usage exceeded threshold (8 occurrences)
  2. Memory usage exceeded threshold (4 occurrences)
  3. Disk usage exceeded threshold (2 occurrences)
```
